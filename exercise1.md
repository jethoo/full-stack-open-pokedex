Backend of the application is being developed in Java. There are different options for linting in Java. But my team is using CheckStyle. Similarly, JUnit and Selenium are being used for unit testing and UI testing. Gradle and Apache Maven are two favorite tools of my team for building Java applications. Azure DevOps and Travis CI are some of the options except GitHub Actions and Jenkins for continuous integration. 

I think there are many factors which are important for deciding which setup to use for CI/CD. Cloud-based environment are growing in number as well as provide huge support system. Some of the advantages of cloud-based environment are no software or hardware infrastructure to maintain. There is no worry for server maintenance or applying software updates and patches. Similarly, SaaS VCS (Version Control System) like GitHub or Bitbucket are easier to maintain. But some of the problems with cloud-based setup are the cost issue to deal with when scaling applications. If the size of application grows, cost also rises for cloud setup. 
Self-hosted environments are very easy for extensibility. When scaling application as well as for enabling functionality not available out of box can be achieved easily with the help of plugins. One down side of self-hosted environment is continuous maintenance of hardware, software patches etc.
